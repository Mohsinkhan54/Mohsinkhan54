### Hi There
### I'm Mohsin Khan, a fresh graduate passionate about web development. For my final year project, I built a Progressive Web App (PWA) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), focusing on course management. The app allows students to browse available courses, enroll in them, and manage their profiles. It also includes features like offline access, smooth performance, and a responsive design to ensure usability across devices.

### Working on this project helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack development, RESTful APIs, state management, and front-end performance optimization. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects.
